### Question 1

Why are recurrent neural networks (RNN) especially suited for modeling sequential data?

(X) They operate on sequences of data and consider all of the inputs given to the model in the past.

(--) Sequential data requires special modeling and RNNs are the only suitable machine learning model type.
  
(--) A RNN is the always the computationally fastest way to model sequential data.
  
(--) They accept as input only time-series data but are very good at predicting the next data point in the sequence.

### Question 2

What does the term "recurrent" mean as used in "Recurrent Neural Network" (RNN)?

(--) A RNN uses convolution recursively to update the weights of the hidden layers.

(X) A RNN can "remember" things learned from prior input; the generated output is copied and sent back into the input, which is a recursive or recurrent process.

(--) The training data is input into a RNN using a recursive process, where the data is updated depending on the output from the hidden layer.

(--) All neural network use a recurrent process when they update the weights in the hidden layer so it's just a preference as to what the process is called.

### Question 3

The term "convolution" is best defined as:

(--) A special mathematical function that can also be used as a loss function.

(--) A mathematical operation that sounds complicated by is really just the multiplication of two functions resulting in a new output function.

(X) A mathematical operation where one function is modified by a second function to produce a third output function which describes that modification.

(--) A mathematical operation that is used only with convolutional neural networks and doesn't have any other applications.

### Question 4

What is the class of task your Autoencoder is best suited for?

(--) Classification of data

(X) Representation of data

(--) Clustering

(--) Semi-supervised learning
